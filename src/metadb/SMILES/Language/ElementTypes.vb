        ''' ##### Disconnected Structures
        ''' 
        ''' Disconnected compounds are written as individual structures separated by a "." (period). 
        ''' The order in which ions or ligands are listed is arbitrary. There is no implied pairing 
        ''' of one charge with another, nor is it necessary to have a net zero charge. If desired, 
        ''' the SMILES of one ion may be imbedded within another as shown in the example of sodium 
        ''' phenoxide.
        ''' 
        ''' Matching pairs of digits following atom specifications imply that the atoms are bonded 
        ''' to each other. The bond may be explicit (bond symbol and/or direction preceding the ring 
        ''' closure digit) or implicit (a nondirectional single or aromatic bond). This is true 
        ''' whether or not the bond ends up as part of a ring.
        ''' 
        ''' Adjacent atoms separated by dot (.) implies that the atoms are Not bonded To Each other. 
        ''' This Is True whether Or Not the atoms are In the same connected component.
        ''' 
        ''' For example, C1.C1 specifies the same molecule as CC(ethane)
