        ''' <summary>
        ''' Continuous type means that each spectrum of an image has the 
        ''' same m/z values. As a result the m/z array is only saved once 
        ''' directly behind the UUID of the file and the intensity arrays 
        ''' of the spectra are following.

        Continuous
        ''' <summary>
        ''' At the processed type every spectrum has its own m/z array. 
        ''' So it is necessary to save both – the m/z array and the 
        ''' corresponding intensity array – per spectrum.
