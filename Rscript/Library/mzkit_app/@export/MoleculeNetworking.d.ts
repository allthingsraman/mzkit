/**
 * Molecular Networking (MN) is a computational strategy that may help visualization and interpretation of the complex data arising from MS analysis.
 * 
 * > MN is able to identify potential similarities among all MS/MS spectra within 
 * >  the dataset and to propagate annotation to unknown but related molecules 
 * >  (Wang et al., 2016). This approach exploits the assumption that structurally
 * >  related molecules produce similar fragmentation patterns, and therefore they 
 * >  should be related within a network (Quinn et al., 2017). In MN, MS/MS data 
 * >  are represented in a graphical form, where each node represents an ion with 
 * >  an associated fragmentation spectrum; the links among the nodes indicate 
 * >  similarities of the spectra. By propagation of the structural information within
 * >  the network, unknown but structurally related molecules can be highlighted
 * >  and successful dereplication can be obtained (Yang et al., 2013); this may
 * >  be particularly useful for metabolite and NPS identification.
 * >  
 * >  MN has been implemented In different fields, particularly metabolomics And 
 * >  drug discovery (Quinn et al., 2017); MN In forensic toxicology was previously
 * >  used by Allard et al. (2019) For the retrospective analysis Of routine 
 * >  cases involving biological sample analysis. Yu et al. (2019) also used MN 
 * >  analysis For the detection Of designer drugs such As NBOMe derivatives And 
 * >  they showed that unknown compounds could be recognized As NBOMe-related 
 * >  substances by MN.
 * >  
 * >  In the present work the Global Natural Products Social platform (GNPS) was 
 * >  exploited to analyze HRMS/MS data obtained from the analysis of seizures 
 * >  collected by the Italian Department of Scientific Investigation of Carabinieri 
 * >  (RIS). The potential of MN to highlight And support the identification of
 * >  unknown NPS belonging to chemical classes such as fentanyls And synthetic
 * >  cannabinoids has been demonstrated.
