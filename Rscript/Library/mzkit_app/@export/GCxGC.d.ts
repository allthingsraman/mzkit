/**
 * Comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography
 *  
 *  Processing GCxGC comprehensive chromatogram data: Comprehensive Two-dimensional gas chromatography, 
 *  or GC×GC is a multidimensional gas chromatography technique that was originally described in 1984 
 *  by J. Calvin Giddings and first successfully implemented in 1991 by Professor Phillips and his 
 *  student Zaiyou Liu.
 * 
 *  GC×GC utilizes two different columns With two different stationary phases. In GC×GC, all Of the 
 *  effluent from the first dimension column Is diverted To the second dimension column via a modulator. 
 *  The modulator quickly traps, Then "injects" the effluent from the first dimension column onto the second 
 *  dimension. This process creates a retention plane Of the 1St dimension separation x 2nd dimension 
 *  separation.
 * 
 *  The Oil And Gas Industry were early adopters Of the technology For the complex oil samples To determine
 *  the many different types Of Hydrocarbons And its isomers. Nowadays In these types Of samples it has been 
 *  reported that over 30000 different compounds could be identified In a crude oil With this Comprehensive 
 *  Chromatography Technology (CCT).
 * 
 *  The CCT evolved from a technology only used In academic R&D laboratories, into a more robust technology 
 *  used In many different industrial labs. Comprehensive Chromatography Is used In forensics, food And flavor, 
 *  environmental, metabolomics, biomarkers And clinical applications. Some Of the most well-established 
 *  research groups In the world that are found In Australia, Italy, the Netherlands, Canada, United States,
 *  And Brazil use this analytical technique.
