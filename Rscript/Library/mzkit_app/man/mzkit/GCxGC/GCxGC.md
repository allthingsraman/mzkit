# GCxGC

Comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography
 
 Processing GCxGC comprehensive chromatogram data: Comprehensive Two-dimensional gas chromatography, 
 or GC×GC is a multidimensional gas chromatography technique that was originally described in 1984 
 by J. Calvin Giddings and first successfully implemented in 1991 by Professor Phillips and his 
 student Zaiyou Liu.

 GC×GC utilizes two different columns With two different stationary phases. In GC×GC, all Of the 
 effluent from the first dimension column Is diverted To the second dimension column via a modulator. 
 The modulator quickly traps, Then "injects" the effluent from the first dimension column onto the second 
 dimension. This process creates a retention plane Of the 1St dimension separation x 2nd dimension 
 separation.

 The Oil And Gas Industry were early adopters Of the technology For the complex oil samples To determine
 the many different types Of Hydrocarbons And its isomers. Nowadays In these types Of samples it has been 
 reported that over 30000 different compounds could be identified In a crude oil With this Comprehensive 
 Chromatography Technology (CCT).

 The CCT evolved from a technology only used In academic R&D laboratories, into a more robust technology 
 used In many different industrial labs. Comprehensive Chromatography Is used In forensics, food And flavor, 
 environmental, metabolomics, biomarkers And clinical applications. Some Of the most well-established 
 research groups In the world that are found In Australia, Italy, the Netherlands, Canada, United States,
 And Brazil use this analytical technique.
