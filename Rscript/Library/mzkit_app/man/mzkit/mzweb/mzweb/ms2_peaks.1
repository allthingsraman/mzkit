.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
extract ms2 peaks data from the mzpack data object
.PP
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
\fBmzpack\fB \fR\- -. 
.PP
.PP
\fBprecursorMz\fB \fR\- 
 if the precursor m/z data is assign by this parameter
 value, then this function will extract the ms2 xic data
 only
. 
.PP
.PP
\fBtolerance\fB \fR\- 
 ppm toleracne error for extract ms2 xic data.
. 
.PP
.PP
\fBcentroid\fB \fR\- 
 and also convert the data to centroid mode? 
. 
.PP
.PP
\fBrt_window\fB \fR\- 
 the rt range for filter of the ms2 spectrum data exports, 
 should be a numeric vector that consists with two elements
 for specific the range min and range max. rt data should 
 be in data unit of seconds.
. 
.PP
.PP
\fBtag_source\fB \fR\- 
 tag the source reference to the metadata of each spectrum data object?
. 
.PP
.PP
\fBenv\fB \fR\- -. 
.PP
.SH DETAILS
.PP
metadata of the spectrum source reference includes data slots:
 
 1. \fBsource\fR, the file name of the spectrum rawdata file source
 2. \fBprecursor\fR, the precursor ion mz of the spectrum data
 3. \fBrt\fR, the retention time of the spectrum data object
