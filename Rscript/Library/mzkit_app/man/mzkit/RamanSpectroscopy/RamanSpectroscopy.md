# RamanSpectroscopy

Raman spectroscopy (/ˈrɑːmən/) (named after physicist C. V. Raman) is a spectroscopic 
 technique typically used to determine vibrational modes of molecules, although rotational
 and other low-frequency modes of systems may also be observed.[1] Raman spectroscopy
 is commonly used in chemistry to provide a structural fingerprint by which molecules 
 can be identified.

 Raman spectroscopy relies upon inelastic scattering Of photons, known As Raman scattering.
 A source Of monochromatic light, usually from a laser In the visible, near infrared, Or 
 near ultraviolet range Is used, although X-rays can also be used. The laser light interacts 
 With molecular vibrations, phonons Or other excitations In the system, resulting In the
 energy Of the laser photons being shifted up Or down. The shift In energy gives information
 about the vibrational modes In the system. Infrared spectroscopy typically yields similar 
 yet complementary information.
 
 Typically, a sample Is illuminated With a laser beam. Electromagnetic radiation from the 
 illuminated spot Is collected With a lens And sent through a monochromator. Elastic 
 scattered radiation at the wavelength corresponding To the laser line (Rayleigh scattering)
 Is filtered out by either a notch filter, edge pass filter, Or a band pass filter, While 
 the rest Of the collected light Is dispersed onto a detector.
 
 Spontaneous Raman scattering Is typically very weak; As a result, For many years the main 
 difficulty In collecting Raman spectra was separating the weak inelastically scattered 
 light from the intense Rayleigh scattered laser light (referred To As "laser rejection"). 
 Historically, Raman spectrometers used holographic gratings And multiple dispersion stages
 To achieve a high degree Of laser rejection. In the past, photomultipliers were the detectors
 Of choice For dispersive Raman setups, which resulted In Long acquisition times. However, 
 modern instrumentation almost universally employs notch Or edge filters For laser rejection.
 Dispersive Single-stage spectrographs (axial transmissive (AT) Or Czerny–Turner (CT) 
 monochromators) paired With CCD detectors are most common although Fourier transform (FT) 
 spectrometers are also common For use With NIR lasers.
 
 The name "Raman spectroscopy" typically refers To vibrational Raman Using laser wavelengths 
 which are Not absorbed by the sample. There are many other variations Of Raman spectroscopy 
 including surface-enhanced Raman, resonance Raman, tip-enhanced Raman, polarized Raman, 
 stimulated Raman, transmission Raman, spatially-offset Raman, And hyper Raman.
