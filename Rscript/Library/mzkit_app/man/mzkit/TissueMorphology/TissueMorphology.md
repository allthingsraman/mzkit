+ [intersect_layer](TissueMorphology/intersect_layer.1) extract the missing tissue pixels based on the ion layer data
+ [UMAPsample](TissueMorphology/UMAPsample.1) create a collection of the umap sample data
+ [TissueData](TissueMorphology/TissueData.1) create a collection of the tissue region dataset
+ [writeCDF](TissueMorphology/writeCDF.1) export the tissue data as cdf file
+ [loadTissue](TissueMorphology/loadTissue.1) load tissue region polygon data
+ [loadUMAP](TissueMorphology/loadUMAP.1) load UMAP data
+ [read.spatialMapping](TissueMorphology/read.spatialMapping.1) read spatial mapping data of STdata mapping to SMdata
+ [splitMapping](TissueMorphology/splitMapping.1) 
+ [gridding](TissueMorphology/gridding.1) create a spatial grid for the spatial spot data
