.SH NAME
centroid \- Converts profiles peak data to peak data in centroid mode.
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fIcentroid(\fBions\fR as any, 
\fBtolerance\fR as any = "da:0.1", 
\fBintoCutoff\fR as double = 0.05, 
\fBparallel\fR as boolean = FALSE, 
\fBaggregate\fR as <generic> AggregateFunction = \fB<NULL>\fR, 
[\fB<Environment>\fR]);\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Converts profiles peak data to peak data in centroid mode.
 
 profile and centroid in Mass Spectrometry?
 
 1. Profile means the continuous wave form in a mass spectrum.
 
   + Number of data points Is large.
   
 2. Centroid means the peaks in a profile data Is changed to bars.
 
   + location of the bar Is center of the profile peak.
   + height of the bar Is area of the profile peak.

 value of this parameter could be 
 
 + a collection of peakMs2 data 
 + a library matrix data 
 + or a dataframe object which should contains at least \fBmz\fR and \fBintensity\fR columns.
 + or just a m/z vector
 + also could be a mzpack data object
