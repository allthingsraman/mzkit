.SH SYNOPSIS
\fImz(\fBmass\fR as double, 
\fBmode\fR as any = "+", 
[\fB<Environment>\fR]);\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION

.SH OPTIONS
.PP
\fBmass\fB \fR\- the target exact mass value. 
.PP
.PP
\fBmode\fB \fR\- 
 this parameter could be two type of data:
 
 1. character of value \fB+\fR or \fB-\fR, means evaluate all m/z for all known precursor types in given ion mode
 2. character of value in precursor type format means calculate mz for the target precursor type
 3. mzcalculator type means calculate mz for the traget precursor type
 4. a list of the mz calculator object and a list of corresponding mz value will be evaluated.
