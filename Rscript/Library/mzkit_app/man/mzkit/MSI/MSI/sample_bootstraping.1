.SH NAME
sample_bootstraping \- make expression bootstrapping of current ion layer
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fIsample_bootstraping(\fBlayer\fR as <generic> SingleIonLayer, 
\fBtissue\fR as <generic> TissueRegion[], 
\fBn\fR as integer = 32, 
\fBcoverage\fR as double = 0.3);\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
make expression bootstrapping of current ion layer
.PP
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
\fBlayer\fB \fR\- The target ion layer to run expression bootstraping. 
.PP
.PP
\fBtissue\fB \fR\- A collection of the @\fBT:BioNovoGene.Analytical.MassSpectrometry.MsImaging.TissueMorphology.TissueRegion\fR object.. 
.PP
.PP
\fBn\fB \fR\- Get n sample points for each tissue region. 
.PP
.PP
\fBcoverage\fB \fR\- The region area coverage for the bootstrapping.. 
.PP
.SH VALUE
.PP
A tuple list object that contains the expression data for each @\fBT:BioNovoGene.Analytical.MassSpectrometry.MsImaging.TissueMorphology.TissueRegion\fR:
 
 1. the tuple key is the label of the tissue region data,
 2. the tuple value is the numeric expression vector that sampling from 
    the corrisponding tissue region, the vector size is equals to the 
    parameter \fBn\fR.

.SH DETAILS
.PP
Bootstrapping is a statistical procedure that resamples a single dataset to create
 many simulated samples. This process allows you to calculate standard errors, 
 construct confidence intervals, and perform hypothesis testing for numerous types of
 sample statistics. Bootstrap methods are alternative approaches to traditional 
 hypothesis testing and are notable for being easier to understand and valid for more 
 conditions.
