.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Extract the ion data matrix
.PP
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
\fBraw\fB \fR\- -. 
.PP
.PP
\fBtopN\fB \fR\- 
 select top N ion feature in each spot and then union the ion features as 
 the features set, this parameter only works when the **`ionSet`** 
 parameter is empty or null.
. 
.PP
.PP
\fBionSet\fB \fR\- 
 A tuple list of the ion dataset range, the tuple list object should 
 be in data format of [unique_id => mz]. Or this parameter value could also
 be a numeric vector of the target m/z feature values
. 
.PP
.PP
\fBmzError\fB \fR\- The mass tolerance of the ion m/z. 
.PP
.PP
\fBenv\fB \fR\- -. 
.PP
.SH VALUE
.PP
the data format of the two kind of the output data result is keeps the same:
 
 + for a raw matrix object, the column is the ion features and the rows is the spatial spots.
 + for a dataset collection vector, the column is also the ion features and the 
   rows is the spatial spots.
