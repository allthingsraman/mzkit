.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Do COW peak alignment and export peaktable
 
 Correlation optimized warping (COW) based on the total ion 
 current (TIC) is a widely used time alignment algorithm 
 (COW-TIC). This approach works successfully on chromatograms 
 containing few compounds and having a well-defined TIC.
