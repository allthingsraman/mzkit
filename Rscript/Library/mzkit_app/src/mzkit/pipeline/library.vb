    ''' 
    ''' Chemical Entities of Biological Interest, also known as ChEBI, is 
    ''' a chemical database and ontology of molecular entities focused on 
    ''' 'small' chemical compounds, that is part of the Open Biomedical 
    ''' Ontologies (OBO) effort at the European Bioinformatics Institute 
    ''' (EBI). The term "molecular entity" refers to any "constitutionally 
    ''' or isotopically distinct atom, molecule, ion, ion pair, radical, 
    ''' radical ion, complex, conformer, etc., identifiable as a separately 
    ''' distinguishable entity". The molecular entities in question are 
    ''' either products of nature or synthetic products which have potential 
    ''' bioactivity. Molecules directly encoded by the genome, such as 
    ''' nucleic acids, proteins and peptides derived from proteins by 
    ''' proteolytic cleavage, are not as a rule included in ChEBI.
    ''' 
    ''' ChEBI uses nomenclature, symbolism And terminology endorsed by the 
    ''' International Union Of Pure And Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) And 
    ''' nomenclature committee Of the International Union Of Biochemistry 
    ''' And Molecular Biology (NC-IUBMB).

    ''' <param name="KEGG">KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) is 
    ''' a collection of databases dealing with genomes, biological pathways, 
    ''' diseases, drugs, and chemical substances. KEGG is utilized for 
    ''' bioinformatics research and education, including data analysis in genomics, 
    ''' metagenomics, metabolomics and other omics studies, modeling and simulation 
    ''' in systems biology, and translational research in drug development.
    ''' 
    ''' The KEGG database project was initiated In 1995 by Minoru Kanehisa, 
    ''' professor at the Institute For Chemical Research, Kyoto University, 
    ''' under the Then ongoing Japanese Human Genome Program. Foreseeing the need 
    ''' For a computerized resource that can be used For biological interpretation 
    ''' Of genome sequence data, he started developing the KEGG PATHWAY database. 
    ''' It Is a collection Of manually drawn KEGG pathway maps representing 
    ''' experimental knowledge On metabolism And various other functions Of the 
    ''' cell And the organism. Each pathway map contains a network Of molecular 
    ''' interactions And reactions And Is designed To link genes In the genome 
    ''' To gene products (mostly proteins) In the pathway. This has enabled the 
    ''' analysis called KEGG pathway mapping, whereby the gene content In the 
    ''' genome Is compared With the KEGG PATHWAY database To examine which 
    ''' pathways And associated functions are likely To be encoded In the 
    ''' genome.
    ''' 
    ''' According to the developers, KEGG Is a "computer representation" of the 
    ''' biological system. It integrates building blocks And wiring diagrams of 
    ''' the system—more specifically, genetic building blocks of genes And proteins, 
    ''' chemical building blocks of small molecules And reactions, And wiring 
    ''' diagrams of molecular interaction And reaction networks. This concept 
    ''' Is realized in the following databases of KEGG, which are categorized 
    ''' into systems, genomic, chemical, And health information.</param>
    ''' <param name="pubchem">PubChem is a database of chemical molecules and 
    ''' their activities against biological assays. The system is maintained by 
    ''' the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), a component of 
    ''' the National Library of Medicine, which is part of the United States National 
    ''' Institutes of Health (NIH). PubChem can be accessed for free through a web 
    ''' user interface. Millions of compound structures and descriptive datasets 
    ''' can be freely downloaded via FTP. PubChem contains multiple substance descriptions 
    ''' and small molecules with fewer than 100 atoms and 1,000 bonds. More than 
    ''' 80 database vendors contribute to the growing PubChem database.</param>
    ''' <param name="HMDB">The Human Metabolome Database (HMDB) is a comprehensive, 
    ''' high-quality, freely accessible, online database of small molecule metabolites 
    ''' found in the human body. It bas been created by the Human Metabolome Project 
    ''' funded by Genome Canada and is one of the first dedicated metabolomics 
    ''' databases. The HMDB facilitates human metabolomics research, including the 
    ''' identification and characterization of human metabolites using NMR spectroscopy, 
    ''' GC-MS spectrometry and LC/MS spectrometry. To aid in this discovery process, 
    ''' the HMDB contains three kinds of data: 1) chemical data, 2) clinical data, and 
    ''' 3) molecular biology/biochemistry data (Fig. 1–3). The chemical data includes 
    ''' 41,514 metabolite structures with detailed descriptions along with nearly

    ''' <param name="metlin">The METLIN Metabolite and Chemical Entity Database is the 
    ''' largest repository of experimental tandem mass spectrometry and neutral loss data 
    ''' acquired from standards. The tandem mass spectrometry data on over 870,000 molecular 
    ''' standards (as of August 16, 2022) is provided to facilitate the identification 
    ''' of chemical entities from tandem mass spectrometry experiments. In addition to the 
    ''' identification of known molecules, it is also useful for identifying unknowns using 
    ''' its similarity searching technology. All tandem mass spectrometry data comes from 
    ''' the experimental analysis of standards at multiple collision energies and in both 
    ''' positive and negative ionization modes.
    ''' 
    ''' METLIN serves as a data management system to assist in metabolite And chemical 
    ''' entity identification by providing public access to its repository of comprehensive 
    ''' MS/MS And neutral loss data. METLIN's annotated list of molecular standards include 
    ''' metabolites and other chemical entities, searching METLIN can be done based on a 
    ''' molecule's tandem mass spectrometry data, neutral loss masses, precursor mass, 
    ''' chemical formula, and structure within the METLIN website. Each molecule is linked
    ''' to outside resources such as the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) for 
    ''' further reference and inquiry. The METLIN database was developed and is maintained 
    ''' solely by the Siuzdak laboratory at The Scripps Research Institute.</param>

    ''' online database containing information on drugs and drug targets created and maintained 
    ''' by the University of Alberta and The Metabolomics Innovation Centre located in Alberta,

    ''' detailed drug (i.e. chemical, pharmacological and pharmaceutical) data with 
    ''' comprehensive drug target (i.e. sequence, structure, and pathway) information. DrugBank 
    ''' has used content from Wikipedia; Wikipedia also often links to Drugbank, posing 
    ''' potential circular reporting issues.</param>

    '''
    ''' The database, originally known As StARlite, was developed by a biotechnology company 
    ''' called Inpharmatica Ltd. later acquired by Galapagos NV. The data was acquired For 
    ''' EMBL In 2008 With an award from The Wellcome Trust, resulting In the creation Of the 
    ''' ChEMBL chemogenomics group at EMBL-EBI, led by John Overington.</param>
    ''' <param name="Wikipedia">Wikipedia is a free-content online encyclopedia written and 
    ''' maintained by a community of volunteers, collectively known as Wikipedians, through
    ''' open collaboration and using a wiki-based editing system called MediaWiki. Wikipedia 
    ''' is the largest and most-read reference work in history. It has consistently been one 
    ''' of the 10 most popular websites in the world, and, as of 2023, ranks as the 4th most
