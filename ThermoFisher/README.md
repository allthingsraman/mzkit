# RawFileReader
RawFilelReader is a group of .Net Assemblies written in C# used to read Thermo Scientific RAW files.  The assemblies can be used to read RAW files on Windows, Linux, and MacOS using C# or other languages that can acces a .Net assembly.

RawFileReader replaces our older product (MSFileReader) which can still be downloaded from our Software Download site (https://thermo.flexnetoperations.com/control/thmo/login?nextURL=%2Fcontrol%2Fthmo%2Fhome)

RawFileReaderExample.cs shows how to access a RAW file using RawFileReader and read header, chromatographic, or spectral data fromm the RAW file.  The program can be complied with Visual Studio 2017, 2019, or 2022 and Visual Studio Code.  You will need to download a copy of the RawFileReader NuGet package files to compile the xample program.  The most recent version that has been released to customers are found in the libs folder.  Older version of the assemblies are stored on our OneDrive site.  To get those versions of the files, please e-mail jim.shofstahl@thermofisher.com for access to our OneDrive site.
