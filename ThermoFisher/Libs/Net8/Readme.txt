This is our .Net 8 version of CommonCore. The NuGet package files are in the same folder as this readme file.  These are the prefered way to use the software
in Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code especially on Linux or Mac.  The extracted assemblies are also included in the Assemblies folder but for most users they
can be ignored.
